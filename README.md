# roboMan
roboMan is a Middleman skeleton that has been configured with a few of my preferred components.

roboMan includes: HAML/Coffeescript/SASS/Markdown/Bootstrap

These instructions assume you have already installed the Middleman gem

# Installation
- Create the ``` ~/.middleman ``` directory if it doesn't already exist.
  - ```mkdir ~/.middleman```

- Clone roboMan into ``` ~/.middleman ```
  - ```git clone git://github.com/nlarso/roboMan.git ~/.middleman/roboMan```

- Initialize a new or existing Middleman project
  - ```middleman init path_to_project --template=roboMan```
